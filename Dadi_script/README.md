# *Dadi* 

Here you will find my scripts for *dadi* simulation

The modified version of dadi used can be download from there [Gitlab_Khalid_Dadi](https://gitlab.mbb.univ-montp2.fr/khalid/dadi/-/tree/master)

This version used an *dual annealing* function to find the optimized likelihood 


You will find 2 version of the same models display in the figure below.
1. Call *model_no_NA* which contained all the models with no change on the ancestral population prior the split/divergence.
2. Call *model_NA_Change* which contained all the models with a change on the ancestral population prior the split/divergence.
